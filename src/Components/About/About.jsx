          As the sun rises over the African Bush and little birds announce a new
          day with songs of joy, the hyenas call each other home after a long
          night's work, and the lions broadcast a last lazy declaration of
          dominion over their kingdom. Their bellies are full, and the day's
          rest is about to begin. But the Pan the wilderness alternative
          Expedition team are wide awake, because they are on a special mission
          to make your African adventure one that you will never forget. Rooms
          are prepared, and mouth-watering meals are artfully brought into
          existence for when our guests return from exploring the exciting

          the incredible fauna and flora, you always learn something on safari
          with our knowledgeable guides. But exciting adventures can be tiring
          and as the sun sets over the African Bush and the lion announces the
          start of the night shift, our wood fire is lit under the stars. For
          this is where the centuries-old tradition of telling stories combines
          your story with ours. This is where you are creating memories that
          will last forever, with people you loveâ€¦ We want to make every
